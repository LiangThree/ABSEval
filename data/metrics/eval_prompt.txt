Model Answer

I would like you to check if there are any missing, redundant, or duplicated steps in these steps.
missing_steps: The script is missing any steps.
redundant_steps: There are steps unrelated to achieving the goal.
duplicate_steps: There are duplicate steps present.
Let's think step by step.

Please answer me in the json format:

{
    "missing_steps":"True",
    "redundant_steps":"True",
    "duplicate_steps": "True",
    "explain": "This script is missing key step XXX. Step x is not related to the target and belongs to redundant steps, but there are no duplicate steps..."
}
