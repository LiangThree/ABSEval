Please play the role of an evaluator.
The question I need you to evaluate is: [QUESTION]
Please note that there are limitations in this issue: [LIMITATION]
The standard answer is:
GOLD_ANSWER

Please evaluate this answer:
MODEL_INFERENCE

The evaluation indicators are as follows:
1. missing_steps: Missing steps compared to standard answer.
2. redundant_steps: There are steps unrelated to achieving the goal.
3. duplicate_steps: There is a behavior that has been repeatedly executed.
4. executable: Whether the steps in the script follow common sense
5. If the script meets the limitations [LIMITATION], meet_limitation is True, otherwise it is False.
6. If the script achieves the goal, complete_goal is True, otherwise it is False.
7. If the sequence of scripts is correct, step_order_correct is True, otherwise it is False.
Please make a strict evaluation, let's think step by step!

Please answer me in the json format:
{
    "missing_steps":"True",
    "redundant_steps":"True",
    "duplicate_steps": "False",
    "executable":"True",
    "meet_limitation":"False",
    "complete_goal":"True",
    "step_order_correct": "False"
}
